# social-cards-webApp
This is a sample react learning project created using create-react-app package.
Ref: https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started.

The application uses following
1. React js for UI
2. Type script coding, type safety etc. 
3. Redux for state management.
4. Formik for creating forms and field validation.

Idea of the project is to create a web application which lets anonymous(anyone on website) to unfold one's experiences by sharing their stories.

The application is still in progress and for now has 2 pages:
1. Stories (List)
2. Share Your Story (Add Story)

The application has no unit tests written for the moment but is the next logical step in application development.
